        "# Thoery Questions\n",
        "Q1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "    An object is a self-contained unit that consists of data (attributes) and behavior (methods). OOP focuses on creating reusable, modular, and scalable code by modeling real-world entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2.What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It encapsulates:\n",
        "\n",
        "   > Attributes (Data/Properties) → Variables that hold the state of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "    > Methods (Functions/Behavior) → Actions that an object can perform.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3.What is an object in OOP ?\n",
        "  - An object is a component of a program that knows how to perform certain actions and how to interact with other elements of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?\n",
        "  - Abstraction is the method of hiding the unwanted information. Whereas encapsulation is a method to hide the data in a single entity or unit along with a method to protect information from outside.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5.What are dunder methods in Python ?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are predefined methods in Python that have double underscores (or “dunders”) at the beginning and end of their names. These methods provide a way to define specific behaviors for built-in operations or functionalities in Python classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. It is a mechanism where you can derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7.What is polymorphism in OOP ?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a specific routine to use variables of different types at different times. Polymorphism in programming gives a program the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is achieved by declaring a class's data members and methods as either private or protected. But in Python, we do not have keywords like public, private, and protected, as in the case of Java. Instead, we achieve this by using single and double underscores.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, a constructor is a special method called when an object is created. Its purpose is to assign values to the data members within the class when an object is initialized. The name of the constructor method is always __init__.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "   -   Class methods can access and modify class-level attributes. They have access to the class object and can modify class variables or create new instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Static methods, on the other hand, do not have access to the class object and cannot modify any class-level attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "   - The concept of method overloading in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods of the same name, but with different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - In object-oriented programming, is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        " -  The @property decorator in Python is a built-in feature that allows you to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for class attributes in a clean and Pythonic way. It helps in:\n",
        "\n",
        "  >Encapsulating attribute access (controlled modification).\n",
        "\n",
        "  >Adding validation logic before setting values.\n",
        "\n",
        "  >Making read-only or computed attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  >Maintaining backward compatibility when modifying attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a specific routine to use variables of different types at different times. Polymorphism in programming gives a program the ability to redefine methods for derived classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed by other classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - Object-Oriented Programming makes updating and maintaining code simpler. Organizing code into separate classes, each handling a specific function, helps OOP keep things clear and easy to work with. You can add new features or make adjustments without impacting other parts of the code when changes are needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "   - Class variables are useful for storing data that is shared among all instances of a class, such as constants or default values. Instance variables are used to store data that is unique to each instance of a class, such as object properties.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. It allows you to create a class that combines behaviors or attributes from multiple other classes, which can be quite powerful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "   - In Python, the __str__() and __repr__() methods are special methods used to define how objects are represented as strings. These methods are crucial for debugging and logging, making it easier to understand the output of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "  - Functions in Python. You use functions in programming to bundle a set of instructions that you want to use repeatedly or that, because of their complexity, are better self-contained in a sub-program and called when needed. That means that a function is a piece of code written to carry out a specified task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "   - In Python, the __del__() method is referred to as a destructor method. It is called after an object's garbage collection occurs, which happens after all references to the item have been destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - The only difference between @classmethod and @staticmethod is that in the @classmethod, the class is bound to the method as the first argument (cls). This means that it is easy to access the class, in the method, via the cls argument, instead of having to use the full class name.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling flexible and reusable code. It works primarily through method overriding and duck typing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining is a common syntax for invoking multiple method calls in object-oriented programming languages. Each method returns an object, allowing the calls to be chained together in a single statement without requiring variables to store the intermediate results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __call__ method is part of Python build-in methods also called dunder or magic methods because have two prefixes and suffix underscores in the method name. The main idea of __call__ method is to write a class and invoke it like a function.   \n",
